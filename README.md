## Sentiment Analysis on Textual Data

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text (e.g., reviews or tweets) into positive or negative sentiments. We use a Naive Bayes classifier for this task and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## Dataset Used
The dataset consists of textual data with two columns:
sentence: The text (e.g., a tweet or review).
sentiment: The sentiment label (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
You can download the dataset from Kaggle or use your own dataset with similar structure.

## Objective
Clean and preprocess the textual data.
Train a machine learning model to classify sentiment (positive/negative).
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

## Conclusion
The sentiment analysis model successfully classifies the sentiment of textual data into positive or negative categories. With a decent accuracy and balanced evaluation metrics, the model demonstrates the effectiveness of basic NLP techniques like text cleaning, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. The project shows how machine learning models can be applied to textual data to derive actionable insights, such as understanding customer feedback or social media sentiment.
